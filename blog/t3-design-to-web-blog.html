<h2>Technical Blog Part 3: Design</h2>

<h3>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important</h3>
<p>A responsive site is one in which the site's features change depending on the the device it is being viewed on to maximise the usability of the site. The change in features should have regard to how the user will be interacting with the site (using a finger rather than a mouse), what would be most useful given the devices capabilities (have a clickable phone number if its accessed on mobile), as well as reflect aesthetic considerations (clarity of font on a small screen, how many columns look best on the page).</p>

<p>Responsiveness is especially important today given the large variety of devices that may be used out there. You want the site to be usable and aesthetically pleasing accross all of them.</p>

<h3>What is mobile first design and why is it important?</h3>
<p>When designing a site you should start designing with mobiles in mind first. This is because this is the smallest  screen so your first consideration will be to identify what the most important elements are first. It is easier to build upon this base rather than add all the features you can fit on a larger screen and peel back from there. It is easier to move from a small apartment to a large house than the other way around.</p>

<h3>What are frameworks and what are their pros and cons?</h3>
<p>A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.a package made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site</p>

<p> The aim of frameworks is to provide a common structure so that developers donâ€™t have to redo it from scratch and can reuse the code provided. So the advantage of frameworks is that they allow us to cut out much of the work and save a lot of time. They also provide solution to common CSS problems.</p>

<p> The disadvantage of using a framework is that you don't learn how to do these things yourself which results in a slower learning curve. </p>



<h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use it?</h3>
<p> A wireframe is a basic visual representation of elements on a website (a sketch of the elements). We use them becuase:
<ul>
<li>They establish a hierachy of infomation.</li>
<li>It simplifies communication.</li>
<li>It gives you a blueprint of where you're going with your site.</li>
</ul>
