<h2>Meditation process</h2>

<h3>Process over product</h3>
<p>This idea enabled me to move forward when I got stuck on the idea of wanting to make my website beautiful. It enabled me to focus in on the important thing, that the website did the function it was made to do, which was provide content in a simple and accessible way.</p>


<h3>Chapter 2 of Search inside yourself: Notes on Meditation</h3>

<p>Meditation is just practice. It is about cultivating certain qualities. These are
<li>Attention; and</li>
<li>Meta-attention, or attention of attention.</li> </p>

<p>Both of these are trainable qualities. It is work not magic.
Meta-Attention is the seret to concentration.It gives you the ability to know when our attention has wandered away. It is like riding a bike, a series of continuous small corrections. Staying on a bike is like staying concentrated, you need to pay attention to where your attention is and continuously correct it.</p>

<p>I liked the idea of happiness being the default position, so the secret to happiness is just to be. The sense of self is not real. It is a constantly restructured ever changing idea. This idea gives you more freedom. </p>

<p>The method of meditation: Pick something to concentrate on, breath being an easy one as it is always present. The best posture is to be alert and relaxed at the same time. I was glad to hear the traditional posture is not required as I find it difficult to sit that way. Train the brain to not automatically react for a few breathes. If it wants to go, let it go, if it wants to be, let it be.</p>

<p>Open awareness or mindfulness and Focus Awareness or concentration. Being very open,like being a good host, let everyone come and go as they will. Focus is a guard, politely turning people away. A good meditator can do both at will. Bending to the wind like grass vs unwavering like a mountain in a storm.</p>
