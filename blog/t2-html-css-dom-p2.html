<h2>Technical Blog Part 2: Udacity Reflection</h2>
<h3>What is grid based design</h3>
<p>Grid based design means looking at a webpage in terms of rows and columns and using this to structure and balance the items on a page. This should ensure the webpage has a clean and usable design. In the Udacity tutorial they divided the paged into 12 columns.</p>

<h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages</h3>
<p>A responsive webpage is important to ensure a consistent experience for users across different devices. It is especially important now that a lot of people access websites on their phone or tablet, as well as on a PC.</p>

<h3>What is semantic struture</h3>
<p>Semantic structure is using natural language to tag items so it is quickly understood to others what each tag means or is used for on the webpage. Examples of semantic elements are table and article. You imediately know what these items are, whereas div is non-semantic as it could be anything.</p>

<h3>Other points</h3>
<p>Something I am hoping to understand better later in the course is the positioning of elements on the grid. Eg using the display: flex function.</p>
