<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>My take on the EDA experience is that a lot of what you get out of it is up to you. Unlike traditional schools there are no tests, grades or ranking encouraging a competitive environment. I like the idea that the more you work together the further you'll get, and I have already found the support of the cohort to be a huge help in staying motivated and making the whole experience more rewarding. It's definitely a tough learning experience having to rely on yourself to get through the constant blocks, so knowing when others are struggling with something but are working through it is encouraging. </p>
<p>In Shereef's fireside chat he acknowledges concern about feeling like your behind the cohort in technology knowledge, but it's comforting to know that everyone can bring something to the group as there is so much to know in coding you never know what you'll stumble upon that is helpful to others.</p>
<p>I think something I underestimated about EDA is just how much of the time I would feel like I didn't know anything about anything. It takes some time getting comfortable with feeling so ignorant a lot of the time, but it's exciting knowing your learning something you find difficult, so although I'm kind of nervous about about this type of learning, I'm definitely excited about trying somthing new and learning in a way I've never learnt before. </p>
