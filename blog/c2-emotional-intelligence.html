<h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
<p>It is easy to see emotional intelligence as something someone is born with. My biggest takeaways from Search Inside Yourself is first how important emotional intelligence is to being successful and healthy and second, that emotional intelligence is a collection of skills and something you can get better at through practice.</p>
<p>What we think, do and pay attention to changes the structure of our brain.</p>
<p>Once you think about it, it is easy to see how emotional intelligence (resilience, optimism and kindness) leads to a happier more successful life. I found the video of meditation particularly helpful. I like the idea that happiness is the default state of mind and something that is always there. You access it by letting everything else settle and allowing yourself to "be" for a while.</p>
<p> Growth comes from resistance. The way to "exercise" your focus is to keep bringing it back to the centre when your mind wanders. I liked the comparison to lifting weights, how it would be ridiculous to consider each lift as failing, yet many people feel disheartened when their mind wanders during meditation. Instead it is said that this is all part of training your focus.</p>
<p>Another idea I found useful was that of naming emotions. Being behind in the course it is easy to feel frazzled with each new wave of assignments but by acknowledging when I feel stressed or overwealmed it almost allows this feeling to be put aside so I can get on with it.</p>
<p>After just 2 minutes of meditation it is a bit like waking up after a sleep. You feel refreshed and able to approach work with new eyes, which is key for problem solving. I find it useful every now and then to stop and remind myself to pay attention to the moment without judging.</p>
