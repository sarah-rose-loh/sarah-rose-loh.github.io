<h2>Time and Habits</h2>
<p>I downloaded the headspace app to try meditating. I found it helpful to have someone talk me through meditation rather than the apps which play you sounds of rainfall or whale calls. It is definitely something I need to get stronger at, especially when I have a lot to do, I find it hard to switch off and live in the moment rather than thinking gotta get through this so I can write about it in my blog and move some sweet waffles on my waffle board.</p>
<p>I tried the tiny habits method, not for the course work directly but to get a bit more physical exercise in my week. Working in an office all day and then coming home to sit at my desk has me feeling quite lethargic and antsy. I have tried having to do 10 push ups or other exercise while the jug boils for a cup of tea, which has been effective. Sometimes. I drink a lot of tea.</p>
<p>I will experiment more with timeboxing, I can see how that would be effective for me to keep me going through blocks. The challenge will be keeping the subsequent break to a reasonable time.</p>
