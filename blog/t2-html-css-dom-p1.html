<h2>Technical Blog Part 1: Udacity Reflection</h2>

<h3>Web design Wishlist</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A simple home page with a large title in a clean font.</li>
  <li>Links to easily share the website on various social media platforms.</li>
  <li>A static header and side bar on the blog posts with movable content in the centre.</li>
  <li>An image background.</li>
  <li>Perhaps image buttons</li>
  <li>The mouse pointer</li>
  <li>A simple colour palette with a few strong images.</li>
  <li>That thing where you move the mouse over a button and it grows a little larger.</li>
</ul>

<h3>HTML,CSS and the DOM </h3>
<p>If a webpage were an American presidential inaugural address, the html would be the words and structure of a speech, the CSS would be  how the voice was used, some words shouted or whispered for impact. Perhaps the speech is said in a different accent. The DOM would perhaps be the script or blueprint of the speech written on flash cards, where you can move different sections of the speech around. Maybe start with God bless America, maybe end with it. This was not a great analogy.</p>

<h3>Boxifying design</h3>
<p>This is looking at the elements on a webpage as a series of boxes organised on the page. Design is all about how to use these boxes, shaping them through CSS and organising them on the page.</p>

<h3>The box model</h3>
<p>Each element or "box" on a webpage consists of a margin, border, padding and content that can be manipulated to create positive and negative space on a webpage</p>
