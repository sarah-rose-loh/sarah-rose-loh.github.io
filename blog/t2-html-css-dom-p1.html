<h2>Technical Blog Part 1: Udacity Reflection</h2>
<h3>HTML,CSS and the DOM </h3>
<p>If a webpage were a presidential inaugural address, the html would be the words and structure of a speech, the CSS would be the how the voice was used, some words shouted or whispered for impact. Perhaps the speech is said in a different accent. The DOM would perhaps be the script or bluerpint of the speech.</p>

<h3>Boxifying design</h3>
<p>This is looking at the elements on a webpage as a series of boxes organised on the page. Design is all about how to use these boxes, shaping them through CSS and organising them on the page.</p>

<h3>The box model</h3>
<p>Each element or "box" on a webpage consists of a margin, border, padding and content that can be manipulated to create positive and negative space on a webpage</p>
